	abstract = {One major challenge encountered with interpreting human genetic variants is the limited understanding of the functional impact of genetic alterations on biological processes. Furthermore, there remains an unmet demand for an efficient survey of the wealth of information on human homologs in model organisms across numerous databases. To efficiently assess the large volume of publically available information, it is important to provide a concise summary of the most relevant information in a rapid user-friendly format. To this end, we created MARRVEL (model organism aggregated resources for rare variant exploration). MARRVEL is a publicly available website that integrates information from six human genetic databases and seven model organism databases. For any given variant or gene, MARRVEL displays information from OMIM, ExAC, ClinVar, Geno2MP, DGV, and DECIPHER. Importantly, it curates model organism-specific databases to concurrently display a concise summary regarding the human gene homologs in budding and fission yeast, worm, fly, fish, mouse, and rat on a single webpage. Experiment-based information on tissue expression, protein subcellular localization, biological process, and molecular function for the human gene and homologs in the seven model organisms are arranged into a concise output. Hence, rather than visiting multiple separate databases for variant and gene analysis, users can obtain important information by searching once through MARRVEL. Altogether, MARRVEL dramatically improves efficiency and accessibility to data collection and facilitates analysis of human genes and variants by cross-disciplinary integration of 18 million records available in public databases to facilitate clinical diagnosis and basic research.},

	abstract = {Despite the clear potential of livestock models of human functional variants to provide important insights into the biological mechanisms driving human diseases and traits, their use to date has been limited. Generating such models via genome editing is costly and time consuming, and it is unclear which variants will have conserved effects across species. In this study we address these issues by studying naturally occurring livestock models of human functional variants. We show that orthologues of over 1.6 million human variants are already segregating in domesticated mammalian species, including several hundred previously directly linked to human traits and diseases. Models of variants linked to particular phenotypes, including metabolomic disorders and height, are preferentially shared across species, meaning studying the genetic basis of these phenotypes is particularly tractable in livestock. Using machine learning we demonstrate it is possible to identify human variants that are more likely to have an existing livestock orthologue, and, importantly, we show that the effects of functional variants are often conserved in livestock, acting on orthologous genes with the same direction of effect. Consequently, this work demonstrates the substantial potential of naturally occurring livestock carriers of orthologues of human functional variants to disentangle their functional impacts.},

	abstract = {TogoVar ( https://togovar.org ) is a database that integrates allele frequencies derived from Japanese populations and provides annotations for variant interpretation. First, a scheme to reanalyze individual-level genome sequence data deposited in the Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA), a controlled-access database, was established to make allele frequencies publicly available. As more Japanese individual-level genome sequence data are deposited in JGA, the sample size employed in TogoVar is expected to increase, contributing to genetic study as reference data for Japanese populations. Second, public datasets of Japanese and non-Japanese populations were integrated into TogoVar to easily compare allele frequencies in Japanese and other populations. Each variant detected in Japanese populations was assigned a TogoVar ID as a permanent identifier. Third, these variants were annotated with molecular consequence, pathogenicity, and literature information for interpreting and prioritizing variants. Here, we introduce the newly developed TogoVar database that compares allele frequencies among Japanese and non-Japanese populations and describes the integrated annotations.},

	abstract = {Laboratory mouse strains have mosaic genomes derived from at least three major subspecies that are distributed in Eurasia. Here, we describe genomic variations in ten inbred strains: Mus musculus musculus-derived BLG2/Ms, NJL/Ms, CHD/Ms, SWN/Ms, and KJR/Ms; M. m. domesticus-derived PGN2/Ms and BFM/Ms; M. m. castaneus-derived HMI/Ms; and JF1/Ms and MSM/Ms, which were derived from a hybrid between M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus. These strains were established by Prof. Moriwaki in the 1980s and are collectively named the "Mishima Battery". These strains show large phenotypic variations in body size and in many physiological traits. We resequenced the genomes of the Mishima Battery strains and performed a comparative genomic analysis with dbSNP data. More than 81 million nucleotide coordinates were identified as variant sites due to the large genetic distances among the mouse subspecies; 8,062,070 new SNP sites were detected in this study, and these may underlie the large phenotypic diversity observed in the Mishima Battery. The new information was collected in a reconstructed genome database, termed MoG+ that includes new application software and viewers. MoG+ intuitively visualizes nucleotide variants in genes and intergenic regions, and amino acid substitutions across the three mouse subspecies. We report statistical data from the resequencing and comparative genomic analyses and newly collected phenotype data of the Mishima Battery, and provide a brief description of the functions of MoG+, which provides a searchable and unique data resource of the numerous genomic variations across the three mouse subspecies. The data in MoG+ will be invaluable for research into phenotype-genotype links in diverse mouse strains.},

	shorttitle = {{TogoID}},
	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btac491},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Understanding life cannot be accomplished without making full use of biological data, which are scattered across databases of diverse categories in life sciences. To connect such data seamlessly, identifier (ID) conversion plays a key role. However, existing ID conversion services have disadvantages, such as covering only a limited range of biological categories of databases, not keeping up with the updates of the original databases and outputs being hard to interpret in the context of biological relations, especially when converting IDs in multiple steps.
RESULTS: TogoID is an ID conversion service implementing unique features with an intuitive web interface and an application programming interface (API) for programmatic access. TogoID currently supports 65 datasets covering various biological categories. TogoID users can perform exploratory multistep conversions to find a path among IDs. To guide the interpretation of biological meanings in the conversions, we crafted an ontology that defines the semantics of the dataset relations.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The TogoID service is freely available on the TogoID website (https://togoid.dbcls.jp/) and the API is also provided to allow programmatic access. To encourage developers to add new dataset pairs, the system stores the configurations of pairs at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/togoid/togoid-config) and accepts the request of additional pairs.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The default view on the ClinVar website, the Variation page, was recently redesigned. The new layout includes several new sections that make it easier to find submitted data as well as summary data such as all diseases and citations reported for the variant. The new design also better represents more complex data such as haplotypes and genotypes, as well as variants that are in ClinVar as part of a haplotype or genotype but have no interpretation for the single variant. ClinVar's variant-centric XML had its production release in April 2019. The ClinVar website and E-utilities both have been updated to support the VCV (variation in ClinVar) accession numbers found in the variant-centric XML file. ClinVar's search engine has been fine-tuned for improved retrieval of search results.},
